# Minimal Debian Sway

For this minimal sway installation firstly you would need a minimal Debian install. I would suggest when tasksel lists the desktop environments to deselect everything and continue with the minimal installation.

## Packages for the minimal install

* sway
* sway-backgrounds
* swaybg
* swayidle
* swaylock
* waybar
* alacritty
* neovim
* ranger
* librewolf
* docker
* git
* sudo
